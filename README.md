# 🌍 S3 Static Website Hosting with CloudFront

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates hosting a multi-page static website on AWS using Amazon S3 and improving performance using Amazon CloudFront.

The website template was downloaded for learning purposes.  
The focus of this project was cloud deployment, CDN integration, and understanding scalable static hosting architecture.

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Static Website Files
- Downloaded a multi-page HTML template.
- Verified all folders: css, js, images, plugins, upload.

---

### Step 2: Create S3 Bucket

1. Go to AWS Console → S3
2. Create a new bucket
3. Disable "Block all public access"
4. Enable Static Website Hosting
5. Configure:
   - Index document → `index.html`
   - Error document → `404error.html`

---

### Step 3: Upload Website Files

- Uploaded all HTML files
- Uploaded css/, js/, images/, plugins/, upload/ folders
- Verified correct folder structure inside S3

---

### Step 4: Configure Bucket Policy

Added public read access to allow website access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 5: Create CloudFront Distribution

1. Go to CloudFront
2. Create Distribution
3. Set Origin → S3 bucket
4. Set Default Root Object → `index.html`
5. Viewer Protocol Policy → Allow HTTP
6. Create Distribution

Wait for deployment (~5–10 minutes)

---

### Step 6: Access Website via CloudFront

- Copied CloudFront domain name
- Verified multi-page navigation
- Confirmed static assets (CSS, JS, images) load correctly

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings
